Yesterday's post ([*This Is What Will Happen*](https://www.hennessysview.com/this-is-what-will-happen/)) struck a chord with some readers. Yet, I was surprised that no one (so far) has said, "Bill, it sounds like you're giving up."

That, to me, is reassuring. The post is mostly about about hope. In fact, it could be the most hopeful post I have ever written. And this probably needs a little explanation.

To bless someone or something means to "set it aside, apart." Specifically, something or someone who is blessed is set apart {{< text-color text="for God's sake" color="red" >}}. 

Though the thing or person blessed does not look or function any differently than before it was set apart for God, it is changed. Something blessed, something intentionally set aside for God, must never again be used for profane purposes. When we use blessed objects or people for profane purposes, we call this "desecration." 

In yesterday's post, we looked at the Holdouts—people who suffer internal exile for refusing to display their vaccine passport. In the post, these Holdouts were forced to band together in small communities that exist within but apart from the "normal" American society. 

The Holdouts give up most of what we think of as modern life: jobs, technology, the entertainment industry, voting. They adopt a lifestyle that was common prior to the industrial revolution, growing their own food, raising their own livestock, building their own homes, educating their own children, nursing their own sick and wounded. It's safe to assume faith sits at the center of their lives, both individually and across their communities. 

Some might speak of how unfair it is that these Holdouts lost their Constitutional, God-given liberties. They were forced to leave the society and the economy they helped build, to give up the blessings of technology and convenience. 

But we must ask, how much of modern life is really a "blessing?" 

Most Americans work to retire. We literally give up our most productive years to save money so we can stop doing what others require of us and start doing what we want to do. In a cruel irony, this day of liberation usually comes in our seventh or eighth decade of life when the tolls of work and age prevent us from doing many of the things we had always wished to do. And these are not always mere amusements, but other kinds of work.

Some things that the blessings of modern life make difficult for me, for instance:

* Stain my deck
* Replace a bathtub 
* Replace carpeting with porcelain tiles in two rooms
* Raising chickens for eggs and food
* Plant a vegetable garden like the one I grew as a kid
* Hike and fish and kayak
* Build a log cabin
* Live off the grid
* Write more 

Yes, I could start these projects and do what I can little fragments of time, weather permitting. Which I will do for some, eventually, when I work up the confidence in my own resourcefulness. 

These are the sorts of activities many people plan to do when they retire. When my father retired in 1987, his children all grown and moved away, he rehabbed the house we grew up in. He rewired the place from top to bottom, replaced the plumbing, rebuilt the dormers on the third floor and replaced their cedar shake coverings with vinyl siding. He replaced most of the windows in the house, remodeled the bathrooms, painted the house top to bottom, inside and out, several times, landscaped the 150-foot by 50-foot backyard twice, and much more. 

Growing up, he and I started all of these projects. But we never finished them. Dad wanted to do these things to make a better home for his family, but he couldn't do that while raising a family. He had to do it *after* his family raised and on their own when he could quick work and take the time. 

Now, let's pretend my dad were a man in his 30s when the pandemic struck and the world lost its head. Supposed he became a Holdout, lost his job and his partially rehabbed home. In humiliation and defeat, he converted his meager savings and pension to cash, packed up what would fit in the family cars, and headed to a small family farmed owned by another man fired from their place of work—a fellow Holdout. 

There, Dad is reunited with half a dozen other former co-workers at a company that had to go along with the "Vaccinated Workforce" campaign that offered juicy carrots to companies that could prove 100 percent of their employees were vaccinated. (Not to mention painful sticks to companies that refused to fire their Holdouts.) 

Seven families on 80 acres in southern Jefferson County, Missouri with one home big enough for one family. 

Luckily, being a small farm, there are several outbuildings that can serve as temporary living quarters for the six exile families. With the families' combined savings, and the rural self-sufficiency of the landlord, they build additional septic systems and upgrade the farm's wells to accommodate the increased population. The exile children spend their first summer learning how to manage a farm, care for livestock, and operate farm equipment. The women make sure the children read and practice math every evening. 

Let's not ignore the troubles. Several of the men in the group did not get along with each other when they worked at the old company, and they don't get along at first. Now, their wives also find fault in each other. My mom doubts she can tolerate living with so-and-so more than a month or two. 

And the kids, of course, pick on each other, fight, shirk duties, get hurt, call each other names, play cruel tricks on the slow kid, and generally "hate" life on the farm. 

The landlord's son, eight-year-old Johnny, despises all the exiles, the interlopers, the intruders into his life. Not only must he share all of his things, he must also share his parents' attentions. They were busy training the exiles. 

Moreover, the sleeping arrangements cause major anxiety. Four of the exile families share a large steel building which also houses tractors, a Bobcat, an old Korean War era Willy's Jeep, and other equipment and material. There are 15 children in these four families, ranging in age from five years to 16. Seven boys and six girls. Sheets hung from ropes separate the boys' quarters from the girls'. The parents are paired off in similar, small curtained quarters. All use two outhouses hastily built in the first days of the adventure. The shower is a garden hose tied to a tree branch with privacy afforded by bed sheets hung from wooden dowels. 

The other two families, with very small children, have it much better. They are are assigned to a small club house on the property with two rooms that serve as apartments for each family. This building has a small galley and a full bathroom, as well. 

The kitchen is a large table covered with various outdoor cooking equipment in one corner of the steel barn where the women and older girls work most of the day to prepare meals for the large
