Identity politics gets a bad rap, and deservedly so. But the problem of identity transcends politics. Strong identification with any group—race, ethnicity, sex, party, religion—weakens both individual *and* the group by opening wormholes through which bad actors climb. 

### Joe Biden Identifies as Catholic

> Error, indeed, is never set forth in its naked deformity, lest, being thus exposed, it should at once be detected. But it is craftily decked out in an attractive dress, so as, by its outward form, to make it appear to the inexperienced (ridiculous as the expression may seem) more true than the truth itself.

— St. Irenaeus of Lyon, *Against Heresy*, ~180 A.D.


I've identified as a Catholic my whole life, but I didn't start acting like one until very recently. 

Oh, I acted like most of the other people who identify as Catholic. And I thought my conformity to the Catholic crowd meant I was *being* Catholic. I was wrong. I was acting like a heathen. 

What's worse, most Catholics *thought* I was being a good Catholic all along. Few considered me a pagan. 

When I began studying what the Church has always taught from, I realized I was a mess. I was about as Catholic as Joe Biden who also identifies as Catholic and, in the words of his press secretary, "attends Mass most Sundays." 

Good for Joe. It's likely that Joe believes himself to be a good, exemplary Catholic, just as I considered myself a pretty good Catholic most of my life. Sure, I sinned a lot, but I did a lot of good to balance that out. And I never complained about the Church teachings I knew but frequently violated. I didn't ask the Church to change her rules for me. Surely, I thought, that's gotta score some points with God, right? 

Being a cradle Catholic with 16 years of Catholic school education, I had the best of both worlds. I was recognized as a Catholic, but I lived like heathen. I made up for my egregious sins by being pleasant with people when I felt like it. And I defended the Church's teachings publicly even while living in flagrant violation of same. Through my fault, my fault, my most previous fault. 

But I got an assist from my identity.

### Identity and First Principles

Imagine that I was raised by atheists. Not the hyper-vigilant, anti-God atheists who want to burn down all the churches (they're not even atheists, but God haters). No, just run of the mill, "spiritual but not religious" agnostic-atheists who believe that people are, by nature, very good and don't really need a god or an afterlife to live right. People who are not "good" are not really bad, but society has put them into a position where anti-social behavior (like rape, robbery, looting, and murder) seems their own hope for a good life. 

Suppose I, at some age, decided to see what all this Catholic stuff is about. Suppose I'm not really interested in what Catholics live like or think like, but why this strange religion came about and evolved at all. Maybe I am an Elon Musk fan, and I want to apply his "first principles" approach to the problem of Catholicism. Instead of starting at the present and working backward, I start at the beginning with Jesus of Nazareth and work my way to the present. 

So, I read all the books of the New Testament and begin reading the so-called Fathers of the Church—accepted Christian writers of the first four centuries after Christ. 

I quickly realize that I need to go back and read the Old Testament. Jesus, they say, is the beginning, but His beginning was foretold in the Old Testament. 

So I read the Old Testament, then hop back to the Fathers. I study the writings of men who knew people who knew Jesus, the men they taught, and the men they taught. 

When I get to about 500 A.D., relatively soon after Christianity became legal in the Roman Empire, I realize there is a lot more to study. I am not quite into the Dark Ages, the time when the Church became the sole repository of wisdom of knowledge and science. So I read on to Aquinas. Then the Council of Trent and its catechism. 

At this point, I am a bit amazed that the Protestant Revolution happened all, and how recently. For three-quarters of the time since Christ's life and death, the Church was remarkably consistent and growing. Then, just 500 years ago, a huge chunk broke off, rejected, not only the Church of 1500, but also the Church of 100, 200, and 300 A.D. I am, frankly, startled by this developed which came as no surprise. I studied history in school, after all. But I was not prepared for this rupture. I expected to find that the Church itself had broken with its earliest followers and leaders sometime around 1100 A.D., but there is nothing to indicate such a departure from the ancients. 

But that's not my area of investigation. I am trying, instead, to understand the first principles of the Church to see why it's such a burden on modern society. So I keep going. 

My endeavor is becoming more difficult, however. For the first 400 years or so, I could focus on original works. More and more, though, the writings are commentaries and expansions on previous works. This means the first principles are behind me, and I must find out where they stopped and where the festooning and reiteration began. Because that will be the point at which the Church was not a problem but a boon to society. 

While others may disagree, I decide that Aquinas' *Summa Theologiae* was the culmination of Catholic first principles. In short, after Aquinas, everything is some sort of criticism of the Church, not a new exposition of the faith. Now, the Protestant Revolution makes more sense. When everything that can be said about a subject has been said, the only way to make your mark is to begin a new field. 

Now, I know my end point. I think I have a good grasp on the first principles of Catholicism. Now, I can go see what these modern Catholics are doing to screw up the world and dominate the Supreme Court. 

### Identity Is Insulation from Truth

If, at this point, I start about their faith with Catholics I know, who do you think my reaction would be?

Pure shock. 

I would hear a lot about loving your neighbor, but few of them could explain *why* you should love your neighbor. Fewer would be able to explain what love means in the context of "love your neighbor." 

I would hear a lot about not judging people, but, when challenged, their answers would beg the question. 

I would hear about protecting the environment, but their reasons for protecting the environment would be completely Sierra Club and devoid of theology or Church teaching. 

I would reach the conclusion that most modern Catholics know less about their professed faith than they know about their family's ethnic homeland. In other words, the Irish can tell me about Ireland and the Germans can tell me about German and the Africans can tell me about Ivory Coast, but none of them can tell me what theological love of neighbor means. 

Yet they tell me they're Catholic.

So I ask the killer question: Why are you Catholic? 

"I don't know. It's how I was raised?" 

### Miguided Is Worse Than Ignorance

The Catholics I talked to were ignorant, but not necessarily misguided. They were lucky. Others are not. 

Those Catholics who also identify as Democrats are probably woefully misguided. 

Having no knowledge of the Church's first principles, they believe whatever seems right to them. If the president can be Catholic and pro-abortion, it must be okay for Catholics to be pro-abortion. If the pope can be pope and support an atheistic world government, atheistic world government must be a Catholic teaching. If Father James Martin, a friend of the pope, supports gay marriage, it must be frustrated old cardinals who keep the Church from changing its rules. 

Remember that, in this hypothetical, I was raised an atheist and learned about the Catholic Church by applying a first-principles approach to my studies. I never said that I believe what the Church teaches. I only *know* what the Church teaches. 

Contrast that with the actual, professed Catholics I encountered. They say they *believe* what the Church teaches, but they don't *know* what the Church teaches. I am insulated against lies about the Church's teachings, but they are insulated against the *truth* of what the Church teaches. 

Put another way, if you wanted someone to learn the faith, you'd be better off sending them to hypothetical me, the atheist, than to most of the lifelong, practicing Catholics I've met in my hypothetical journey!

And, here the hypothetical ends with this aphorism: Identity insulates us from the truth. 

### Identity Politics

At some point in history, Blacks believed they would gain an advantage by identifying with Democrats. 

At some point in history, conservatives believed they would gain an advantage by identifying with Republicans. 

At some point in history, Trump voters believe they would gain and advantage by identifying with Fox News. 

Identities are very painful to break. Having quit smoking several times, I've learned that one of the most painful losses one feels in quitting is losing his identity as a smoker.

When you quit smoking, you go through two days of being so tired you'd kill someone for a nap. That hurts. But it doesn't hurt as much, or as long, as watching your old smoking buddies leaving you behind when they go out to the patio for their 10:00 smoke break. And 10 years after your last cigarette, you still know you'll never look as cool as James Dean with that Camel hanging from his smile or Don Draper with the ever-present Lucky Strike balanced in his right hand. 

Psychologists say that one of the challenges of getting someone to lose weight is overcoming and replacing their identity as a fat person. 

We tend to believe whatever we have to believe to be consistent with our identities. Because, if you're not what you identify with, what the hell are you?

We even have a name for situations where reality conflicts with our identity: identity crisis. 

An identity crisis occurs when we can no longer pretend we are what we've portrayed ourselves to be. While there's a lot of 70s psychobabble related to identity crisis, it's real. We will fight valiantly to hold onto the myths we've built around ourselves. 

When we allow reality to overcome our identity, it's called "growth." When we allow our identity to overcome reality, it's call "psychosis." 

The modern world prefers psychosis to reality. Thus, psychoses proliferate. 


### This Won't Change the World, But How You See It

Sorry to disappoint, but I don't have a universal solution to our present identity crisis. And you're probably not going to like what I'm about to write. 

The reality is that America has succumbed to a global, atheistic, socialist government. Our identity is as a sovereign republic. 

But that's on the national level.

On a personal level, we are as free as we were in 1789. Yet, personally, we tend to identify as enslaved surfs. 

Go with reality. This won't roll back the tide of global socialism, but it will spare you the pain of psychosis. You have complete control over how you respond to America's surrender.
