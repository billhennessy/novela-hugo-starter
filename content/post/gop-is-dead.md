Donald Trump will go down in history as the last Republican to hold the White House. Just read this:

> **A lot of people said they aren’t really Republicans, that, like, they’re for Trump. That’s it** … I think the base is getting stronger, truly. I think an impeachment would make him even more powerful — a conviction, is what I mean.

That's leftist Politico reporter Tara Palmeri ([as seen on The Gateway Pundit](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/01/getting-stronger-liberal-reporter-gets-wake-call-trump-support/)) describing the large group of Wyoming voters she interviewed. Palmeri was in Wyoming to take a pulse check on voters in Liz Cheney's district. 

What Tara learned on her field trip is something that's obvious to anyone who's read my blog for the last eight years. [**Republicans cannot win the White House without support of blue collar voters**](https://hennessysview.com/2015/12/22/party-like-its-1992/). But Republican pollsters don't get it. They never have. The Republican pollsters are Mitt Romney types. 

The GOP has two irresistable forces working against it:

1. Without Trump, the party lacks the electoral college distribution to win the White House.
2. Because the GOP closed its eyes to election fraud, no election will ever be on the up-and-up again. 

Because of the GOP's increasing cowardice and lack of principles, I have already announced that I will not cast another Republican vote for any office. I am done. And, unless or until there is a dramatic reckoning for the election fraud of 2020, I will not vote at all. 

But I'm a weirdo. The people Tara Palmeri spoke to are not weirdos; they're the people who put Trump in the White House, who gave Republicans control of the House and Senate, and who filled state legislatures with Republicans. 

What did the GOP with this gift from working men and women (many of whom never voted Republican before 2020)? The GOP pissed all over the voters. They refused to enact any of President Trump's initiatives. They refused to strike back against the laughably false accusations of Russian collusion. They refused to challenge obviously and incontrovertibly stolen elections. They blamed President Trump for a riot organized and led by Antifa. 

And, then, after spitting in the eye of every Republican voter in the country, the GOP burst our inboxes with pleas for money. 

Money for the GOP? HELL NO! Never. Not one penny from anyone who stood in the trenches in our fight against bailouts and ObamaCare. Not a penny, not a vote from anyone who cried and prayed on their knees in thanksgiving to God when Pennsylvania and Ohio were called for Trump in 2016. Not a penny for those gutless, self-serving weasels. 

That is why the Republican Party is doomed. 

The GOP will hang around as a local party for some time. It takes a while for a new party to build strength. Republican Party hacks will start a campaign to convince potential candidates that no third-party candidate can win any race. And many people will believe them. 

But most people who run for a school board secretly (unconsciously) see themselves rising the political ranks. State representative, state senator, US House, US Senate, whatever. But that career path no longer exists for Republicans. 

For a time, governor or US Senator is the highest possible office for a Republican, and only if the Democrats do not decide to rig that particular race, about which more in due course. 

When that becomes obvious (and it will after the GOP candidate for president gets shellacked in 2024), the Senate will look less attractive. Especially when you consider that the Democrats will never allow a Republican majority in the House or Senate ever again. They don't have to: they own the voting system. 

Then, governor will be the top prize for a political careerist. The only problem is that governors are not very powerful in a country run completely by Washington DC. By 2024, states will have been so stripped of self-governance that a governor will be little more than a divisional manager, and administrator, carrying out the orders dictated by Washington's burgeoning bureaucracy. 

At that point, no one with political ambitions will run as a Republican, even for a local office. Why would they? If you want to be a politician, you might as well give yourself a chance at the top. Why limit yourself to state rep or senator?

I cast my first vote in March of 1982. It was a special election of some sort. Only like two issues and one candidate on the ballot. At the time, I lived in the City of St. Louis, so there was no Republican on the ballot.

The next time I voted, in the 1982 August primary, I asked for a Republican ballot. The guy running the polling place, who was a friend of my dad's, called my dad at work to make sure it was okay that I was asking for a Republican ballot. In 1984, I finally got the chance to vote for Ronald Reagan. Until 2016, that was the proudest vote I ever cast. 

Donald Trump, though, represented the spirit of the Tea Party, except for the spending. His primary appeal was that he was not a politician. He did not try to act like a politician. He did not arm himself is softeners and carefully chosen words. He spoke the truth and threatened the Deep State. And he kept his promises despite the concerted opposition of Democrats, the media, and most of the GOP. 

When the GOP abandoned Trump, they also abandoned about six million Trump-only voters. In course of his presidency, Trump also won the loyalty of tens of millions of lifelong Republican voters. Neither of those two groups will consider themselves Republicans again. They can't. Calling oneself a "Republican" is to call oneself a selfish, backstabbing coward. I might be a weirdo, but I'm not a Republican. 

The GOP is dead, and it has no one to blame but its own leaders. 

(Check back in 4 years to see if I was right.)
