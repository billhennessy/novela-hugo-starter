Major Leave Baseball must benefit from election fraud. 

Last July, I posted "[The End of America](https://www.hennessysview.com/the-end-of-america/)," which has aged quite well, unfortunately. 

It is altogether fitting and proper (apologies to Abe Lincoln) that the "American pastime" should decide to kill itself now. 

Major League Baseball announced yesterday that it is boycotting Georgia. The reason? Georgia passed a law to prevent another stolen, sham election. 

By caving to a demand by Joe Biden, MLB entered the political fray with both feet siding with the Democrats and their allies who rig elections. 

[President Donald Trump has called on all Americans to boycott baseball](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/04/president-trump-releases-statement-boycott-baseball-companies-interfering-fair-free-elections-listening-coke-delta/), Coca-Cola, and Delta Airlines. I second his call.

For myself, I hope never to attend a Major League Baseball game again. I'm done with the boring, expensive pastime. I hope the people who read this blog will end any attachments to the sport, as well. 

Make Major League Baseball an unAmerican has-been. Boycott baseball.
