I just had the great privilege to join a massive prayer call with our old friend Ed Martin. On that prayer was [Bishop Leon Benjamin](https://benjamin4congress.com/) who taught us that we are living in America's Red Sea moment.

Think back to Exodus 14. Moses was leading the Hebrews out of Egypt when the pharaoh changed his mind and sent 600 chariots to slaughter the Hebrews. 

The people were fearful and angry at Moses and God for taking them out of Egypt only to die on the banks of the Red Sea. At that moment, there was nothing Hebrews could to counter an attack by the pharaoh's army. They felt powerless and vulnerable. And abandoned. 

But Moses cried to God for help, and God delivered. The Lord told Moses to raise his staff and lift his hand over the sea. Moses obeyed, the sea parted, and the Hebrews passed over on dry land. 

When the Hebrews were safely across, the pharaoh's army followed them, only to be swallowed up and drowned when God released the waters he'd held back for the Hebrews. 

### Stuck Between a Swamp and a Deep State

Now, the good bishop reminded us, is our Red Sea moment. President Trump led us out of our slavery to the Deep State, but the Deep State changed its mind. We feel trapped and vulnerable on the banks of the great Swamp. We cannot turn back to the Deep State, and we cannot move forward without God's help. 

The bishop told us the Moses' staff is God's power while Moses' hand is our power. We must first raise our staff to God who will guide our hand in leading the people through the Swamp. 

Folks, we have tried to do this ourselves for decades, and we have, quite frankly, made a mess of things. It's time to humble ourselves before the Lord who made heaven and earth. I believe He has brought us to the banks of the Swamp for a reason: His reason. And His reason is enough for me. 

We will not devise a successful strategy to fight the Marxist hordes ourselves. We must stop being creative and imaginative. We must admit that our plans didn't work. 

### Help Is a Prayer Away

But that's a far cry from giving up. No, we don't give up unless we believe we, ourselves, are the highest power available to us. Thankfully, man is not the highest power. We can and we must turn to God and hope. 

Hope only matters when you're out of ideas. I've been searching for ideas from other people, other smart people, and there are none. Trust me, the internet is empty of ideas. We are trapped between the Deep State and the Swamp. We have been fighting both using our intellect and our strength, but both are exhausted. 

In other words, God has us right where He wants us. We have nowhere to turn but to Him. 

Arrayed against us, influencing and informing our adversaries, is The Enemy. The dark one. And, while spiritual battles can seem frightening, we know that the dark forces are subject to God's holy will.

### The Armor of God

Therefore, our real battle is not against the Swamp Creatures or the Deep State. When we fight them, we only make them stronger. Our answer comes from Ephesians 6:


> Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. **Put on the full armor of God**, so that you can take your stand against the devilâ€™s schemes. For **our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms**. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with **the belt of truth buckled around your waist**, with **the breastplate of righteousness in place**, and with **your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace**. In addition to all this, **take up the shield of faith**, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. **Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit**, which is the word of God.

When Moses turned to God instead of trusting himself, the Red Sea parted, the Hebrews escaped, and their enemies were destroyed. We are trapped. Our methods have failed. Our knowledge is useless. We have nowhere else to turn but to God. 

> The Lord ruleth me: and I shall want nothing.  
> He hath set me in a place of pasture. He hath brought me up, on the water of refreshment:  
> He hath converted my soul. He hath led me on the paths of justice, for his own name's sake.  
> For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me.  
> Thou hast prepared a table before me against them that afflict me. Thou hast anointed my head with oil; and my chalice which inebriateth me, how goodly is it!  
> And thy mercy will follow me all the days of my life. And that I may dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days.

And don't forget to [forgive your enemies](https://hennessysview.com/my-secret-plan-for-america/), pray for them, thank them for bringing us closer to God. (If you need [more justification for forgiving our enemies, read this](https://hennessysview.com/why-should-we-forgive/).)

Peace.
