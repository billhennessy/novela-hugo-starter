Shortly after 200 A.D., men and women began migrating to the Scetes desert of Egypt. They were not building cities or seeking their fortunes. They resigned to the desert to pray. These were the Early Desert Fathers, and they offer wisdom and guidance in these dark times. 


When the ascetic movement began, Christianity was still illegal in the Roman Empire. Persecution, torture, and death became a way of life for the Early Christians. The story of St. Lawrence of Rome (d. 258) illustrates the times:

> On ... August 10, 258, Lawrence was tortured by having his arms dislocated and then was laid upon a grill and slowly roasted to death. During his ordeal, he is said to have suggested his killers turn him over, remarking that he was "done" on the one side. He was so calm that the pagans who looked on were greatly impressed ([source](https://www.christianity.com/church/church-history/timeline/1-300/st-lawrence-grilled-by-greedy-official-11629625.html)).

It would easy, though unfair, to assume the the Desert Fathers were simply fleeing Roman persecution. But nothing could be further from the truth. The first well-known Desert Father, Anthony of Egypt, was a wealthy young man who gave away his inheritance to live in a small cell he built himself, dedicating his life to God. When the persecutions ended with the Edict of Milan in 313, people continued to flock to the desert. Most were leaving a better life for one far worse, at least by most people's standards of living.

But the hermits and monks of the desert wanted only to please God, not other men and certainly not their own flesh.
